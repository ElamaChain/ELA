# ELAMACHAIN Platform

ELAMACHAIN project is a comprehensive emotional AI platform based on Hyperledger architecture.

ELAMACHAIN platform integrates blockchain technology and AI services to meet the needs of individual
users and businesses in connection with existing ecosystem, including real-time cryptocurrency payment
system and crypto-payable installments in retail area.

ELA Coin(ELAMA) sustains Elamachain’s ecosystem by continuously connecting needs of customers, who are
rewarded for data contribution to AI system and enjoy various embedded service network with ELAC, merchants,
who can greatly benefit from business promotion and cryptocurrency payments, and business partners who can
improve their competiveness via AI solutions provided by ELAMACHAIN platform.

Since ELAMACHAIN platform is based on Hyperledger blockchain, it surpasses existing AI services in numerous
areas. Existing blockchain AI projects suffer from slow transaction speed and low data collection rate due to
its immobile blockchain structure. ELAMACHAIN platform’s Hyperledger blockchain enables the foundation of building
functional blockchain AI from its private blockchain-like property. Modularized structure also provides greater
scalability to swiftly adopt newly updated consensus, attach dApp with little effort, and aggresively expand service areas.

ELAMACHAIN platform’s AI system, AI ELA’s competitiveness against exising centralized AI services is obvious.
With increasing public attention and regulatory actions, information privacy has risen to be a major concern for
heavily centralized database of IT giants. Privacy protection and data security that can be ensured through blockchain
network’s distributed storage are clear advantage for an AI in a era of data flood.

Even in its earlier AI maturement, ELAMACHAIN platform is capable of offering attractive ecosystem to parties
of interest by being linked to solid “real-world” usage infrastructure. As ELAMACHAIN Foundation is already operating
working payment infrastructure in pre-paid card services and POS installments, crypto-payment mainly by means of ELAC
can be easily implemented for daily use. Also, ELAMACHAIN has built strategic partnership with Korean plastic surgery
hospitals and duty-free shops, which target Chinese visitors with high purchase power, that can maximize the utility of
ELAC-use environment.

## Vision

The vision of Elamachain project is to mark AI ELA as another official open-source project of Hyperledger. Elamachain
has built, over time, development basis, business connections, and supporting community to fulfill that goal.
ELAMACHAIN platform would be a spearhead of devloping open-source AI in Hyperledger project for all individuals and
business to freely share and enjoy the ideas and fruits of the project.
